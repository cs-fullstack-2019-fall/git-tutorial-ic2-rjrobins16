### WELCOME TO CODE SCHOOL
 
Our Code School is a hands-on class designed to train individuals to be entry-level software developers within a six-month course. The minimum education requirement is at least a high school diploma or GED. Students work in a small classroom setting and use real-word technologies to learn the fundamentals of coding, app development, the leadership, and the life skills needed for a successful career and job market competitiveness.

I wanted to join Code Crew to challenge myself by learning new skills, create better websites and make more money!
